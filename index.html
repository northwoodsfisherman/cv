          <em>My name is Dorrie and I am a Labradoddle that lives in New Hampshire.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was born in Maine and had eight
            brothers and sisters.
            <br>
            They were all bigger than me but I showed them I could fend for myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            When it came time to move on from my Maine family I chose parents in New Hampshire.
            <br>
            Yes, that is right.... I chose them. I knew a good thing when I saw it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have it made here. Good food, warm house,good health care.
            <br>
            Basically, I get what I want and run the household.
